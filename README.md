## Code Structure

The calculator is organized into clean, reusable methods:

- `addition(double a, double b)` - Performs addition
- `subtraction(double a, double b)` - Performs subtraction  
- `multiplication(double a, double b)` - Performs multiplication
- `division(double a, double b)` - Performs division
- `main(String[] args)` - Main program loop with input handling

## Error Handling

The calculator handles common errors gracefully:

- **Invalid number input:** Prompts user to re-enter valid numbers
- **Division by zero:** Shows error message and continues to next calculation
- **Invalid operators:** Alerts user to use valid operators (+, -, *, /)
- **Mixed input types:** Automatically clears invalid input and prompts again

## Technical Details

- **Language:** Java
- **Input Method:** Scanner class for console input
- **Loop Structure:** While loop for continuous calculations
- **Exception Handling:** Try-catch blocks for InputMismatchException
- **Output Formatting:** Printf for 2-decimal place formatting
